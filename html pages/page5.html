    <h1>Conclusion</h1>

    <div>
      <h5>Did they perform to your expectations?</h5>
      <p>
        React performed to our expectations as we were able to accomplish our
        initial idea of creating a social media feed page. Something that was
        interesting about React was that the project did not behave as a
        single-page file like with HTML. A React project is composed of many
        files and folders that are responsible for the building and deployment
        of the application on localhost.[INSERT BACKEND INFO HERE]
      </p>

      <h5>Were they difficult to install or configure?</h5>
      <p>
        React wasn't extremely difficult to install. We had to install Node.js
        and Next.js packages beforehand in order to create a React app through
        the terminal. However, building and deploying React using Github Pages
        was very difficult as we had many unexpected compile errors. In order to
        fix our errors, we recreated our React app in a whole new GitHub
        repository. [BACKEND INFO HERE]
      </p>

      <h5>
        Was it easy to create the page(s) with it? Was the learning curve steep
        compared with regular HTML/CSS/JavaScript/PHP?
      </h5>
      <p>
        React was easier to use than anticipated. Since it is such an expansive
        and strong framework, we were worried that it would take many hours to
        learn how to code in React however, we were able to begin coding some
        basic elements after watching a few tutorials on YouTube. There was a
        bit of a learning curve and we didn't have much experience coding in
        Javascript but React's component format coding style was easy to
        understand. [BACKEND INFO]
      </p>

      <h5>
        Would you have done things differently in retrospect? Did you regret
        your choice of frameworks?
      </h5>
      <p>
        It was a bit of a challenge assembling React with our backend server. If
        we could redo the project, it would've been best if we did more research
        on the different frameworks available and which would've been the best
        to choose in terms of our skillset with both frontend and backend
        development. We would also start researching in advance to give more
        time to better handle any unexpected issues or errors we'd come across.
